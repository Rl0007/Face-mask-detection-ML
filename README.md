# Face mask detection 

In this project I have used python to make a model which detects wether a person is wearing mask or not .
In this project I have used 6500 images both with and without mask and a person can see the result through the website



## Demo


### Without mask

#### Desc :- Person without mask shown in red box with accuracy

### With mask

#### Desc :- Person with mask shown in green box with accuracy

### Login page of website

#### Desc :- login page

### Home page with data

#### Desc :- Bottom of home page with footer

### Graph

## Deployment

To deploy this project run steps :-
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Use train.py to train model if another dataset used
3. project.py is the main project run it with webcam on if no webcam you can use droidcam application
4. Web.py is the flask framework web application use it to see results in webpage .
5. user.db is the user database 
6. wearmask.db contains database of mask worn
```bash
  Pip install requirements.txt
```

```bash
  python train.py
```
```bash
  python project.py
```
```bash
  python web.py
```
